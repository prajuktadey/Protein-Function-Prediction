# Protein-Function-Prediction

Protein function classification is an important task in bioinformatics and computational biology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to effectively model and analyze graph-structured data, such as protein-protein interaction networks or protein structure graphs. In this context, GNNs can be used to classify proteins based on their functions by learning the underlying patterns and relationships within the graph data.
